This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.

The purpose of this project is to practice applying JavaScript to HTML and CSS.


What I learned:

-DOM Manipulation with JavaScript (targeting, creating, and editing nodes)

-Creating event listeners 

 -Using them for user interaction and dynamic styling of the page
 
 -Calling functions with user inputs as parameters
 
-Better use of html structure and CSS grid to create proper layout before coding

-Designing the webpage layout by hand as a prototype first before implementing in code
