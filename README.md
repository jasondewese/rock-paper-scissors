This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.

The purpose of this project is to practice applying JavaScript to html and css.


What I learned:
-DOM Manipulation with JavaScript (targeting, creating, and editing nodes)
-Creating event listeners 
    -Using them for user interaction and dynamic styling of the page
    -Calling functions with user inputs as parameters
-Better use of html structure and CSS grid to create proper layout before coding
